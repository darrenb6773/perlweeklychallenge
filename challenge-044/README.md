I was tempted by this weeks challenge, and it's 'goal seeking' concept.
Seemed just the right kind of task for an 'old school' language.
Cracked out my rusty Prolog skills, installed SWI-Prolog and got to know Prolog a lot better.

I think this will be my only (unsupported) attempt for this weeks challenge, 
as I've got a lot of new employment opportunites to research for and hopefully to apply.
